# Hardening-the-Windows-OS-Strategies-for-Enhanced-Security
Strengthen your Windows system with proven techniques for enhanced security and resilience. on your Operating Systems.

Implementing the Principle of Least Privilege to Protect Against Ransomware and Threats
The Principle of Least Privilege is a cornerstone of cybersecurity defense. Ensuring users only have the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks significantly reduces the risk of ransomware and other threats. Hereâ€™s a practical example:
Scenario: An unknown user account has permissions to access a sensitive storage drive.
Solution: To secure the storage drive:
Identify the Account:


Right-click the storage drive and select Properties.
Navigate to the Security tab and review the list of users.
Deny Permissions:


Select the suspicious account (e.g., UNKNOWN USER).
Click Edit and set Deny for all permissions.
Apply Changes:


Confirm the changes by clicking Apply, then OK.
This approach ensures unauthorized users cannot access or modify critical files, mitigating potential vulnerabilities. The photo below depicts the properties then security tab when right clicking my storage drive.



2. Regularly Update Your Windows OS and Applications
Ensure your Windows OS is always up to date by enabling automatic updates. Regularly installing security patches and updates protects your system from vulnerabilities and zero day threats. To check for updates, go to Settings >System > Windows Update, and click Check for updates.



3. Windows Defender and Security

Enable Reputation-Based Protection
Improve your system's security by enabling Reputation-Based Protection in Windows Security. Here's how:
Search for Windows Security in the Start menu and open it.
Navigate to App & Browser Control.
Turn on Reputation-Based Protection.
This setting helps identify and block potentially malicious downloads or links, alerting you to threats and preventing unsafe files from executing from your browser.
Enable Core Isolation in Windows Security
For enhanced protection, navigate to the Device Security tab in Windows Security and enable Core Isolation. This feature adds an extra layer of defense by preventing attackers from injecting malicious code into the Windows Kernel, safeguarding your system's core processes.

4. Disable Autoplay to Prevent Unauthorized Media Execution  

To enhance security, disable Autoplay by navigating to **Settings > Bluetooth & Devices > Autoplay** and toggling it off.  

This prevents media such as CDs, USB drives, and other external devices from automatically executing files upon insertion. Disabling Autoplay protects against threats like:  
- Malware and Viruses: Prevents malicious software from running automatically.  
- Unauthorized Access: Stops potentially harmful scripts or programs embedded in removable media.  
- Data Breaches: Reduces the risk of sensitive information being exposed through unauthorized execution of files.  

By disabling Autoplay, you ensure that only intentional actions trigger file execution, giving you greater control over what runs on your system.



5. Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network)  When Browsing the Web


Encrypts Your Internet Traffic: A VPN secures data transmission, protecting sensitive information from hackers, especially on public Wi-Fi.


Protects Your Privacy: By masking your IP address, a VPN prevents websites, advertisers, and ISPs from tracking your online activity.


Bypasses Geo-Restrictions: VPNs enable access to blocked content by routing your traffic through servers in other locations.


Prevents ISP Monitoring: VPNs keep your browsing private by hiding your activity from your Internet Service Provider.


VPNs such as ExpressVpn, Nord VPN, VPN Shark are all viable options.
